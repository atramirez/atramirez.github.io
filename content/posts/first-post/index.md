title: I Finally Made This!
---

## What is This?

Hello, welcome to my "blog" if you can call it that. I have always wanted a place to write throughts
and experiences in my technical adventures. This is that, though I have absolutely no plans to
do this consistently or even well. So with that

## What Will Be Here

I will add posts about what I feel like at the time, sometimes I get the itch to write or share.
Some things I might add:

- About new projects
- Thoughts on happenings in aviation, space, programming, really anything I find interesting
- Technical challenges
- New experiences in programming

## That Was Quick

Well that's about all I had planned to talk about here. Partly I have to figure out how this works.
I have little to no will to write a website from scratch right now. This will be pretty casual, feel free to check
out more about me or such for now, I have links to my Github/Gitlab, and ways to get ahold of me on the home
page. I am going to go write some C now! Thanks for reading, see you in the next one.
